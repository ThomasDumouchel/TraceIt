<h4>Motivation:</h4>

<p>
My sister and I enjoy painting. Through years of practice, we got pretty good at it! Now we would want to jump into bigger and more complicated projects. One such project is the recreation of "The Last Supper" painting by Leonardo Da Vinci*  on a 60" x 30" canvas. However, we will change Jesus's face and the one of every apostle with the face of important characters of our lives.

Working on this big of a scale obligates us to work smarter, since we are talking about a lot of materials that could be wasted, but also our time too. Thus, we decided to draw with pencil the image first, using rulers, compasses and whatnot to achieve a drawing that would be as true to the original. Then, we would go over with the oil paint to complete our masterpiece.

The app I'm building is to help with the first part of the process i.e. tracing the image with pencil.
